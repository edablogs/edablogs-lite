## <span style="color: #e69138;">Sound clarity patch :</span>

In latest modded version of resurrection remix rom named as Double remix rom has increased sound, but due to this mod voice quality is not so good and not clear. So here is patch for this. It has original libs and config files from resurrection-remix 7.2.2 as suggested by Arnav.  

### <span style="color: #274e13;">Download from below :</span>

1.  Download this file and put in your mobile's internal memory or sdcard.

<div style="text-align: center;">[Download Now](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/55163217/sound_patch.zip)</div>

5.  Now start TWRP recovery and flash that downloaded file (sound_patch.zip).
6.  Reboot your device.
7.  No need to wipe cache.

Thanks to Arnav for suggesting these files. :)
