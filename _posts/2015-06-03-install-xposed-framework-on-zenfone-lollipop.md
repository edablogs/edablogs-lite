Hello **Asus Zenfone** users, Recently Lollipop is officially launched by Asus for all **zenfone** models. so there is big change from **Kitkat to Lollipop**, And compatibility of some apps has gone. In same way **xposed framework** also not supporting on lollipop. So Developer of **_xposed framework_** has release [Alpha version](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle "Software release life cycle") to make it compatible on **Lollipop ROM** too. but unfortunatly some zenfone series have x86 (32 bit) processor. So xposed framework not working on zenfone mobiles. So **Shakalaka** has made it working on Zenfone too. he has compiled it from xposed framework Sources.

### How to prevent from Bootloop After xposed :

if you have enable some xposed module which is not supported with xposed alpha or your mobile, then your mobile will be stuck on Asus LOGO. and is latest Lollipop ROM recovery is inside system partition, means if your mobile not starting then you also unable to go into recovery mode. So you cant reset your mobile. (<span style="color: red;">* to make recovery to work on Lollipop when you are unable to start recovery, just flash recovery.img from old Kitkat rom</span>).

So to recover from Bootloop without factory reset just install "**_TWRP recovery_**" on your mobile.   

*   Download TWRP recovery for Zenfone 5 from below link. How to install TWRP recovery read here  (<span style="color: red;">* this method is for installing Philz recovery, method is same the only difference of recovery name</span>)

[Read this thread](http://www.xdablogs.com/2015/06/twrp-recovery-for-zenfone-5-stable.html)

*   After installing TWRP recovery go into recovery mode by going into **Bootloader** mode and select "**Recovery**".
*   after selecting recovery you will be unable to start recovery, so just reboot your mobile and you will into TWRP recovery.
*   Now you are in TWRP recovery goto "**_File Manager_**" and open "**_data_**" folder then again open "**_data_**" folder then  open "**_de.robv.android.xposedd.installer_**" there will be folder name "**_shared_prefs_**" open that folder and delete "**_enabled_modules.xml_**" file.
*   now restart your mobile and your mobile will start normally and you need to enable xposed modules again. so now be careful before enabling modules.
