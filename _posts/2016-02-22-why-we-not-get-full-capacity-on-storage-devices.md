## <span style="color: #ff6600;">Reason behind why we get less capacity in storage devices :</span>

Have you ever think that why we not got full capacity on any storage device like Pendrive,SD Card,Harddisk or any other storage device? for example if we buy a **2TB (2000GB)** harddisk then we got only **1.81TB** only. Some of us maybe thinks that this missing space is reserved by hardware or something else. but answer is really tricky. Actually here is fact behind this

### because EVERY company counts:

> 1000 B for 1 KB  
> 1000 KB for 1 MB  
> 1000 MB for 1 GB and  
> 1000 GB for 1 TB,

while its actually (1KB have 1024 B instead of 1000B) so this will be

> 1024 B for 1 KB  
> 1024 KB for 1 MB  
> 1024 MB for 1 GB and  
> 1024 GB for 1 TB.

So lets do the company's math: they think we need <span style="color: #ff6600;">**2*1000*1000*1000*1000**</span> = **<span style="color: #ff6600;">2.000.000.000.000 B</span>** to get **2TB.** But thats wrong! If we reverse the math with the right numbers we get this: <span style="color: #ff6600;">**2.000.000.000.000/1024/1024/10Â­24/1024**</span> = **1,81TB**

Thats why its only 1.81TB in 2TB harddisk. So whenever you buy new storage device you can estimate how much capacity you get in that.
